"""## Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks

In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

### Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

#add a value for the first variable
Number_A = 8

#add the value for the second variable
Number_B = 10

#write the code to sum the both variable
print (Number_A + Number_B)

#after i run the code the answer or result will be printed and the answer will be '18'
